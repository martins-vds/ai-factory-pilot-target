**State:** blocked  ·  **Branch / PR:** copilot/bk-05g-continue-dialogs-not-routed-table  ·  **Last commit:** 188581d
### Done
- See this branch's commits and `afs-run` journal.
### Remaining
- [ ] These files are outside ticket BK-05G's planned files: `.migration/handoffs/BK-05G.bk05e-dashboard-template.md`. Don't widen your own scope: revert them, or, if the work truly needs them, write a handoff (afs-handoff) that names each file and why, set `handoff:` in your return, and stop. The operator decides.
### Blockers / questions
- self-check failed: `afs-finish-check` still found 1 problem(s) after its retry budget (ADR-0034). Written by the stop hook, not by the agent.
### Next step for the next session
Fix the items under Remaining, run `afs-finish-check`, and commit. Scope items need the operator.

### Remaining
- [ ] You changed another role's or ticket's return file: `.migration/returns/BK-05G.afs-specialist-migrator.yaml`. A session writes only its own return (`.migration/returns/BK-05G.afs-verifier.yaml`). Restore each one exactly as it was on your base branch (`git checkout <base> -- <file>`) and commit.
