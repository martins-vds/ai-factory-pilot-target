**State:** blocked · **Branch / PR:** `copilot/bk-05f-build-route-selection-itinerary-screens` / https://github.com/martins-vds/ai-factory-pilot-target/pull/394 · **Last commit:** ae812f5

### Done
- Route selection and itinerary screens render cargo details, candidate counts, numbered route/leg data, candidate routes when present, and the characterized empty-state guidance.
- Candidate assignment uses `CargoRouting.assign_route`, verifies the current route specification, and redirects to cargo details. Focused UI tests cover assignment, the redirect/details page, invalid candidate tokens, unsupported methods and unknown cargo.
- The full behavior suite passed with 467 tests (`.migration/runs/BK-05F/20261107T233102987871Z-behavior-security-fix.log`); build, idiom and CRAP gates passed. Migration validation last passed with 193 files and zero errors.
- CodeQL reported `py/url-redirection` at `views.py:38`; the redirect tracking-ID path segment was quoted. The required post-fix CodeQL verification has not yet run.

### Remaining
- [ ] Resolve the changed-code mutation gate shortfall (0.790, minimum 0.8) and rerun the exact profile command.
- [ ] Commit the current redirect-sanitization and test changes, then rerun CodeQL and address any remaining alert.
- [ ] Update the return/evidence with the final mutation result and rerun migration validation.

### Decisions made
- Candidate itineraries are signed in the form so assignment uses the itinerary rendered to the user rather than regenerating randomized candidates on POST.
- The redirect tracking ID is URL-quoted after CodeQL identified it as untrusted redirect data.

### Blockers / questions
- The migration contract stop rule fired after two changed-code mutation attempts reported the same score, 0.790 below the required 0.8. The next session should inspect why the existing interface assertions do not kill the surviving mutants before attempting another run.

### Failing commands
- `python .migration/harness/tools/afs-mutation --changed-since origin/main` → exit 1, see `.migration/runs/BK-05F/20261107T233256117827Z-mutation-changed-security-fix.log`.
- `python .migration/harness/tools/afs-mutation --changed-since origin/main` → exit 1, see `.migration/runs/BK-05F/20261107T233600196049Z-mutation-changed-after-404-test.log`.

### Next step for the next session
Resume BK-05F by reproducing and resolving the mutation-score shortfall first; then commit the pending fix, rerun CodeQL, update the return file, and validate all evidence.
